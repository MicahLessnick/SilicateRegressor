# SilicateRegressor
Logistic regressor to analyze ocean data and classify sampling location

This was done as part of the chemical and physical oceanography course at Eckerd college. The goal of the project was to use silicate concentrations (umol/kg) to identify the sampling location environment (estuary vs open-ocean). Normalized data is provided within this repository and raw data was retrieved from the geotraces, chesapeake bay, and tampa bay databases.
